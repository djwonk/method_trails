  # A +Match+ is an object passed back from +each_match+ and its family of
  # methods.
  #
  # Ultimately, all matches between rules and s-expressions happen because
  # their component atom(s) match up.
  #
  # A +Match+ object contains information about the match, including:
  #
  #   1. the atom that matched
  #      Do I mean the most recent atom that matched?
  #      Do I mean the top-most atom that matched?
  #      Do I mean the bottom-most atom that matched?
  #
  #   2. s-expression containing the atom that matched
  #
  #
  #   3. semantic children of the atom that matched
  #
  # It might be helpful to know that a Match knows nothing about the
  # Rule that caused the match to happen.
