class MethodTrails
  module MethodCalls

    attr_accessor :log_filename

    # Returns a hash that contains the information extracted when running
    # the rules.
    #
    # Typically the top level of the hash contains keys that match up with
    # the labels of the various rules.  For example:
    #
    #   :classes_and_i_methods
    #   :i_methods_and_ids
    #
    # Below the top level, the hash's structure is driven by what each rule
    # requests to be captured.  For example:
    #
    #   { :classes_and_i_methods =>
    #     [
    #       {
    #         "class" => ["MusicalPerformance"],
    #         "def"   => ["initialize"]
    #       }
    #     ]
    #   }
    #
    #   Or another example:
    #
    #   { :i_methods_and_ids =>
    #     [
    #       {
    #         "ident" => ["announce_song", "gets_quieter"],
    #         "def"   => ["initialize",    "initialize"]
    #       }
    #     ]
    #   }
