    module RuleMatch

      # Each time +rule_s_exp+ matches +subject_s_exp+, iterate over block
      # (+b+), passing a Match object as the yield parameter.
      #
      # Parameters:
      #   +rule+    : s-expression for a Rule (or portion of a Rule)
      #   +subject+ : s-expression for the subject (i.e. parsed Ruby)
      #   +match+   : Match object, stores information about the match
      #   +b+       : called for each match (block or lambda)
      #
      # Return value:
      #   Using the block (+b+) means that the return value is not needed.
      #
      # More information:
      #
      #   Note that the +rule_s_exp+ drives the process.  There is no need
      #   to dig deeper into +subject_s_exp+ than the rule cares about.
      #
      #   Note that by match we mean a 'head to toe' match; starting at the
      #   head, moving to the toes.*  First, we check for a match between
      #   the top of the Rule and the top of the expression.  If that
      #   succeeds, we go down one level.  And so on.
      #
      #   * Yes, a rule can branch, therefore having more than one toe.
      #     Though such rules seem messy, they can be quite useful.
