        # Each time the rule matches +subject_s_exp+, iterate over block (+b).
        #
        # Parameters:
        #   +type+    : rule type (Symbol), i.e. :__child
        #   +rx+      : left part of rule (Atom or SExp)
        #   +ry+      : right part of rule (Atom or SExp)
        #   +subject+ : the subject being explored (SExp)
        #
        # Interestingly, most of the logic in this code treats each type of
        # rule in much the same way.  Rule types only differ in two ways:
        #
        #   1. Where they look for matches right now
        #      (See each_typed_rule for more information.  It ultimately
        #      relies on each_possible_matches_with_index.)
        #
        #   2. Where they explore for matches in the future
        #      (See each_future for more information.  It ultimately relies
        #      on get_future_for_type.)

        #   +permissive+ : Be more permissive with atom matching.
